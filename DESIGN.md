## Purpose of Directories

- `cmd`: Contains individual folders for different commands.

- `pkg`: Houses reusable packages potentially useful in other projects.

- `internal`: For private application code not intended for external use.

- `scripts`: Includes useful scripts for building, testing, and more.

## Design Decisions

### Validate
1. A  `-o_<type>` convention is used to allow for multiple outputs across subcommands.
2. An in-memory SQLite database is attached in read-only mode, ensuring the input database is not altered.
3. Batch inserts through a single goroutine are employed to minimize concurrency issues with SQLite and to reduce the number of round trips. This is necessary since consistency is desired over speed.
4. A single SQL query with rc_exist and fim_exist columns is relied upon, allowing the database to handle processing instead of in-memory go logic.
5. CSV rows are written one by one to avoid substantial memory usage at the end of processing.
6. Specified output files, even if empty, are generated to keep API consistent.
7. Atomic writes with a temporary file are performed for CSVs so no partial CSVs remain if errors occur.
8. Local directories are not processed with gdal_ls, preserving fast local operations and avoiding unnecessary dependencies.
